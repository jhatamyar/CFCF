\title{Causal forest learned (cross-fitted) with training and holdout data, fit
over K folds. Forests are estimated with all but i folds,
then estimates are predicted for the holdout (ith) fold. This is repeated
a specified number of times and the results are averaged across folds.}

CFCF(X, Y, W, K = 5, reps = 4, num.trees = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of covariates, dimension n rows by m columns}

\item{Y}{a vector of outcomes, dimension 1xn}

\item{W}{a vector of treatment status, dimension 1Xn}

\item{K}{the number of folds to be used in cross-fitting, default is 5}

\item{reps}{the number of times to repeat the cross-fitting, default is 4}

\item{num.trees}{the number of trees to be fitted in the causal forest, default is 2000}
